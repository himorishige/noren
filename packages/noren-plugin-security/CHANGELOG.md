## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/himorishige/noren/pull/14) [`963b5fa`](https://github.com/himorishige/noren/commit/963b5fa609c475db430a2cd71f9358fc047fcd4b) Thanks [@himorishige](https://github.com/himorishige)! - Release 0.2.0 across all packages.

  This minor release improves documentation, test coverage, and loader ergonomics while keeping public APIs stable.

  Highlights:

  - Dictionary Reloader: documented file loader and baseDir option, clarified file:// URL validation and security notes, added Cloudflare Workers KV/R2 and bundle-embedded examples, shipped dictionary/manifest templates, included compile() examples, and kept the ESM extension handling fix.
  - Core and Plugins (US/JP): aligned masking behavior (no digits left after masking), updated tests, and standardized maskers to receive Hit-shaped inputs. No API changes.

  Upgrade notes:

  - No breaking changes expected. If you use file:// URLs, ensure they pass the documented validation and configure baseDir accordingly.
